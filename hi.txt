This React file serves as the main entry point of the application. It sets up global providers for things like data fetching (via React Query), tooltips, and toast notifications, ensuring these features work across all pages. Using React Router, it defines navigation paths for different pages such as RiderSelection, Dashboard, Reports, and RealtimeCommand, along with a fallback NotFound page for invalid URLs. In short, this component acts as the central hub that connects all parts of the app and manages how users move between them
This file is the entry point of the React app. It imports the main App component, global styles, and uses React’s createRoot() method to render the app inside the HTML element with the ID "root". Essentially, it’s what boots up the entire React application, linking your JavaScript code to the web page so everything can display and run in the browser.
